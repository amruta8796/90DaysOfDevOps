   - Share your understanding of DevOps based on the video and your research. Cover the following points:

     - **What is DevOps:**
        DevOps is a software development practice that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to deliver better, more reliable software faster.

     - **What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure:**
       Automation involves automating the entire software delivery process, from code creation to testing, deployment, and monitoring. 
       Scaling consists of designing and implementing systems that can handle increased load and traffic.
       Infrastructure involves designing and managing the hardware and software required to run applications and services.

       
     - **Why DevOps is Important:**
       
       DevOps is important because it helps teams work better together to build and deliver software faster and more reliably.
       Automating processes speeds up development, improves quality, and reduces errors. 
       DevOps also helps teams respond quickly to issues and customer feedback, making software more stable and efficient. 
       In short, DevOps allows companies to deliver better software, faster, with fewer problems.
 

4. **Engage with the Community:**
   - Share your LinkedIn post or article link in the community forum or on social media using the hashtags #90DaysOfDevOps and #TrainWithShubham.
   - Read and comment on posts from other participants to foster a collaborative learning environment.
